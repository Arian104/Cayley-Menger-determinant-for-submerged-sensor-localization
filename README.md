# Cayley-Menger-determinant-for-submerged-sensor-localization
This repository presents theoretical approaches and computational methods for submerged sensor localization using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The approach leverages distance-based geometric constraints to determine the precise 3D coordinates of submerged sensors using a set of surface beacons.
